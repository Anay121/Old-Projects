Some stuff i made when starting off programming <br>

- 2048 is a basic c++ version of the mobile game of the same name.<br>
- Pokemon text game is a basic version of the Popular game Pokemon, one of my favs, and is my attempt at creating a simple playable game. It'll be under constant development

These are all the current files that i have for now...
